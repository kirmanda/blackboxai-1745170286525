# Steganography File Hiding and Extraction Service

## Project Overview
This project is a Node.js application that utilizes Express.js to create a web service for hiding and extracting files using steganography techniques. The application enables users to upload files, including a cover file (e.g., an image or audio file) and a secret file (any type of file), to be concealed within the cover file, and allows for the extraction of the hidden files with the use of a password.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine. This project relies on both.

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. You will also need to have `ffmpeg`, `Pillow`, `pydub`, and `cryptography` installed in your Python environment. You can install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow pydub cryptography
   ```

5. You may need to install `ffmpeg`. Instructions can be found on the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Usage
To start the server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Hiding a File
To hide a file, make a POST request to `/api/hide` with the following form data:
- `coverFile`: The cover file in which to hide the secret file (image or audio).
- `secretFile`: The file you want to hide (any type).
- `password`: A password used for encryption.

### Extracting a File
To extract a hidden file, make a POST request to `/api/extract` with the following form data:
- `stegoFile`: The combined file with the hidden secret file.
- `password`: The password used during the hiding process.

## Features
- Uploads cover and secret files for hiding.
- Supports password protection for extracting hidden files.
- Handles basic errors with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Allows users to download the resulting file or extracted files directly.

## Dependencies
This project has the following dependencies defined in `package.json`:
- **express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **express-fileupload**: A middleware for handling file uploads.

To install these requirements, simply run:
```bash
npm install
```

Additionally, the Python script (`steganography.py`) depends on:
- **Pillow**: For image handling.
- **pydub**: For audio handling.
- **cryptography**: For data encryption.
Make sure to install these packages in your Python environment.
